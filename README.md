## Description
Accolade offers the ability to organize and track all of the achievables in a video game, allowing the member to determine when they have completed a game in it's entirety and can move on to the next one. Using a comprehensive API, we are able to pull unqiue information about a game, including the title, description, release date, and the platform/console on which it's available. Each profile has status categories, enabling the user to keep track of which games they are currently playing, have yet to play, and the games that have been fully completed. Each game within a profile contains a list that the user creates, containing all of the different tasks that they would like to finish. Once they have completed a task, they can mark it as "Done", and will change the status of the item to an "accolade". Accolades are stored in a separate list of accomplishments in the game profile to assist with organization.
